<br>  

## This is an exercise for building and printing a binarytree
This exercise builds a binary tree using the information on the Input.txt and using the linked list method with BinaryNode class.  
After constructing the binary tree, it can be able to print the binary tree using the orders available:  

## printInOrder:
Prints the binary tree in a order which the left node of each root node of each tree and subtree is printed first, then the root node itself and finally the right node is visited and printed.

## printPreOrder:
Prints the binary tree in a order which the root node of each tree and subtree is printed first, then the left node of each root node and finally the right node is visited and printed.

## printPostOrder:
Prints the binary tree in a order which the left node of each root node of each tree and subtree is printed first, then the right node and finally the root node itself is visited and printed.

### This is a data structures and algorithms exercise
